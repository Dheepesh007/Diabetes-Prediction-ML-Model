# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning Project

This project uses **Machine Learning** techniques to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on various health parameters.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  

Each model was trained, tested, and evaluated using several performance metrics.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**
- **F1 Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve and AUC**

---

## 📈 Performance Summary
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.78 | 0.77 | 0.75 | 0.76 |
| Random Forest | 0.85 | 0.84 | 0.83 | 0.83 |
| XGBoost | 0.88 | 0.87 | 0.86 | 0.86 |

*(These are sample values; actual results may vary based on dataset splits.)*
